The goal of this project was to use Erlang and the actor model to build a good solution to the bitcoin mining problem that runs well on multi-core machines. 
Our code was simultaneously run on 8 machines with one functioning as server and the other 7 as workers, and we were able to mine a coin with 7 leading zeroes.

Technologies used: Erlang
